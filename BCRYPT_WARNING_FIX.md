# Bcrypt Warning Fix

## Warning Message
```
WARNING:passlib.handlers.bcrypt:(trapped) error reading bcrypt version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/passlib/handlers/bcrypt.py", line 620, in _load_backend_mixin
    version = _bcrypt.__about__.__version__
```

## What This Means
`passlib` is trying to detect the bcrypt library version but failing. However, this is **non-critical** - `passlib` will automatically fall back to a working bcrypt implementation.

## Impact
- ⚠️ Warning message appears in logs
- ✅ Authentication **still works correctly**
- ✅ Password hashing **still works correctly**

## Fix (Optional)
If you want to eliminate the warning:

1. **Updated `requirements.txt`** (already done):
   ```
   bcrypt>=4.0.0
   passlib[bcrypt]>=1.7.4
   ```

2. **Rebuild Docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Added verification in `auth.py`** (already done):
   The app now tests bcrypt on startup to ensure it's working.

## Verification
After rebuilding, check the container logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs voice-api | grep -i bcrypt
```

You should see:
```
✅ Bcrypt is working correctly
```

Instead of the warning.

## Conclusion
The warning is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality. The fix above will eliminate it, but it's **not urgent** if authentication is working.
